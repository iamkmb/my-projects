    "**THE ADARNA BIRD (Ang Ibong Adarna)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once upon a time, in a land far far away, a Kingdom called Berbania existed. It was ruled by King Fernando together with his lovely better half, Queen Valeriana. They were blessed with three sons namely Prince Pedro, Prince Diego, and Prince Juan.\n",
    "\n",
    "One day,the King became ill. The only cure to the King's illness is the magical Adarna bird, who perches at the tree of Piedras Platas in the mountain of Tabor. The King ordered the 3 princes to catch and bring the bird back to their Kingdom. The succession of the throne will be given as a reward to whoever catches the magical bird.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Now the adventure begins as the three princes embark their journey to catch the ever elusive Adarna.\n",
